       <i> Sitting here wasted and wounded At this old piano <br>
        Trying hard to capture The moment this morning I don't know <br>
        'Cause a bottle of Vodka's still lodged in my hand <br>
        And some blonde gave me nightmares I Think that she's still in my bed <br>
        As I dream about movies They won't make of me when I'm dead <br> <br> 
        
        
        With an ironclad fist I wake up and french kiss the morning <br>
        While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head While we're talking <br>
        About all of the things that I long to believe, <br>
        About love, the truth, what you mean to me <br>
        And the truth is, Baby you're all that I need <br> <br>


        I want lay you down in a bed of roses <br>
        for tonigh I'll sleep on a bed of nails <br>
        I want to be just as close as, the Holy Ghost is, <br>
        and lay you down on a bed of roses. </i>
